## Data Visualization final project

### Project Goal: Uncover what makes a movie successful, closely examining various factors that contribute to a film's reception and financial performance, such as directors, actors, genre, trailer sentiment, and budget.

### Project Data: We used two publicly available movie datasets for our visualiztion analysis

Both datasets can be found on Kaggle:
● IMDb Dataset: Comprised of several features like titles, genres, ratings, release dates, synopses, cast and crew, budgets, and production details, which is ideal for predictive modeling of film success
