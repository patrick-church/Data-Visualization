## Data Visualization Final Project

### Project Description: 
To uncover the factors that most impact a Hollywood film's reception and financial performance, we utilized the Python data visualization libraries Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn to develop various types of visualizations using industry movie data, including box plots, line graphs, bar graphs, bubble charts, scatter plots, and pie charts, visualizing variables such as directors, actors, genre, trailer sentiment, and budget, to understand how they impact a film's overall success. We constructed a report to house our visualizations and describe the insights our visualizations showcase.

### Project Data: We used two publicly available movie datasets for our visualiztion analysis, merging them to gain a more widespread and accurate understanding of the film industry's dynamics.

#### Both datasets can be found on Kaggle:

- IMDb Dataset: Comprised of several features like titles, genres, ratings, release dates, synopses, cast and crew, budgets, and production details, which is ideal for predictive modeling of film success.

- YouTube Movie Trailers Dataset: Shares many features with the IMDb dataset but also provides trailer sentiment analysis.

### Methodology: Utilized the Python data visualization libraries Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn to develop various types of visualizations, including box plots, line graphs, bar graphs, bubble charts, scatter plots, and pie charts, to visualize the factors that impact a movie's reception and financial performance.
